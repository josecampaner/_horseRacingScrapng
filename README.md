# Horse Racing Scraping

This project scrapes horse racing data and exposes several API endpoints using Flask. It stores the results in a PostgreSQL database.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection using the environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`.
3. Run `python app.py` to start the API server.

For detailed installation steps see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
